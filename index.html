            <h1>The Approach</h1>
            <p>This project covered a 12-week period. A meeting with the project manager and stakeholders to discuss the project served as the project's official launch. We, as the design team, started working after we were given the project documentation.
                We used a heuristic evaluation method, which is a quick and effective way to solve problems or make decisions, keeping in mind the time frame provided by the stakeholders. We categorized our thought process into:
            </p>

            <li>Understanding the users’ needs (empathize) </li>
            <li>Competitive analysis research. </li>
            <li>Wireframing</li>
            <li>Testing/Iterating</li>
            <li>Providing a final solution</li>
            <li>Prototyping </li>






            <h1>Understanding the users’ needs</h1>
            <p>Getting to know the users and their pain points This is the most crucial stage of the process since we want to create solutions that address customer issues and advance the business objective. If the solution is usable, users will continue
                using it, and the company will continue to expand. To better understand our users and gain practical insights from them, user interviews were needed. Below are the interview questions and the results of their responses.
